 Adapted from Oliver Wilkinson
 The class is a singleton, so to access the class use:
 
 GSAudio.sharedInstance
 for example, to play a sound you would call:
 
 GSAudio.sharedInstance.playSound("AudioFileName")
 and to play a number of sounds at once:
 
 GSAudio.sharedInstance.playSounds("AudioFileName1", "AudioFileName2")
 or you could load up the sounds in an array somewhere and call the playSounds function that accepts an array:
 
 let sounds = ["AudioFileName1", "AudioFileName2"]
 GSAudio.sharedInstance.playSounds(sounds)
 I also added a playSounds function that allows you to delay each sound being played in a cascade kind of format. So:
 
 let soundFileNames = ["SoundFileName1", "SoundFileName2", "SoundFileName3"]
 GSAudio.sharedInstance.playSounds(soundFileNames, withDelay: 1.0)
 would play sound2 a second after sound1, then sound3 would play a second after sound2 etc.
